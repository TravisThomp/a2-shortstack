# Website About
My website acts as a item tracker for user to calculate how much an item would cost in a quantity.
The website only functions with unique item name's. I used flex display to organize my webpage into 2 sides for entry form and my display table.

# Technical Achievement
My webpage uses only one page. It allows for the user to add data by using the left side panel. Additionally data can be removed by clicking the delete button on the right side
